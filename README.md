# Soybean-Flowers-Detection
This project introduces a method based on Faster RCNN to detect the number of soybean flowers to solve the problem of manual counting of soybean flowers. Help breeders understand the genetic mechanism of flower drop and increase soybean yield. The project code comes from the official website of [MxNet](https://cv.gluon.ai/build/examples_detection/train_faster_rcnn_voc.html#sphx-glr-build-examples-detection-train-faster-rcnn-voc-py), modified to be used for soybean flower count problem
